node-map
========

Playing around with node.js and Mapbox.

1. Create a `config/database.coffee` file
2. Enter your database url.

```
module.exports =
  mongo_url: "mongodb://user:pass@url.com:port/database"
```

3. `npm install`
4. `npm install -g coffee-script`
5. `coffee app.server`
6. Lift off!

This was just a first go at node.js.
